# Berkeley Pacman AI Projects

This repository contains implementations of AI assignments based on the
**Berkeley Pacman Projects**, an educational framework used to teach
foundational artificial intelligence concepts.

#### The projects focus on classical search algorithms and decision-making in multi-agent environments, using the Pacman game as a testbed.

## Projects Included

### Project 1 - Search Algorithms

Implemented classical search techniques to navigate Pacman through mazes:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)**
- **A* Search**, with admissible heuristics

These algorithms model the maze as a state space and find paths toward
goals efficiently.

### Project 2 - Multi-Agent Search

Extended the search framework to **adversarial settings** with ghosts:

- **Reflex Agent**
- **Minimax Agent**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Expectimax**

Also includes custom **evaluation functions** to guide Pacman’s decisions
in the presence of opponents.

- Problem modeling as a **state space**
- Uninformed and informed search strategies
- Adversarial decision-making
- Heuristic design and evaluation
